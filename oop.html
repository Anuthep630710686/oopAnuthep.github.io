    <h1>OOP Concepts</h1>
    <p>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, known as methods.</p>

    <h2>Key Components of OOP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Class:</strong> A blueprint or template for creating objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Object:</strong> An instance of a class.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclass:</strong> A class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class.</li>
        <li><strong>Message:</strong> A request for an object to perform one of its methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> The mechanism by which one class is derived from another.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of an object to take on many forms.</li>
    </ul>
